# Aurora Compute Templates

This repository contains the source of the templates we use at PCextrem on our [Aurora Compute](https://www.pcextreme.nl/aurora/compute) platform.

The templates are automaticlly build using [HashiCorp Packer](https://packer.io/) on our [GitLab CI](https://about.gitlab.com/features/gitlab-ci-cd/) server.
Afterwards the resulting templates are pushed to [Aurora Objects](https://www.pcextreme.com/aurora/objects) from where they are available to download, as well as available for selection when creating an [Aurora Compute](https://www.pcextreme.nl/aurora/compute) instance.
